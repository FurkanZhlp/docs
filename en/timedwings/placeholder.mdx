title: PlaceholderAPI Support
---

TimedWings includes built-in support for **PlaceholderAPI**, allowing you to display flight time and flight status in scoreboards, menus, tablists, and other plugin GUIs.

---

## ✅ Enabling Placeholder Support

If PlaceholderAPI is installed, TimedWings will automatically detect and register its placeholders.

No extra configuration is needed.

You can confirm it's working by checking your console:

```
[TimedWings - INFO] PlaceholderAPI detected, registering placeholders...
```

---

## 📌 Available Placeholders

### `%timedwings_total_flight_time%`

Returns the **formatted remaining flight time** for the player.

- Example output: `15m 30s`
- Format is configurable via language files:

```yaml
placeholder:
  timedwings_total_flight_time:
    time: '{y} {mo} {d} {h} {m} {s}'
    no-time: '&cNo Time Left'
```

If the player has **no flight time**, the `no-time` message is shown instead.

---

### `%timedwings_total_flight_time_seconds%`

Returns the **raw remaining flight time in seconds**.

- Example output: `930`
- Format also configurable via:

```yaml
placeholder:
  timedwings_total_flight_time_seconds:
    time: '{seconds}'
    no-time: '&cNo Time Left'
```

This is useful for more precise displays, like countdown timers or progress bars.

## ⏱️ Time Format Tokens

TimedWings uses a custom formatting system to represent flight time. You can structure the time format using the following tokens:

| Key     | Description              | Example Output       |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| `{y}`   | Years                    | `1 year`, `2 years`  |
| `{mo}`  | Months                   | `3 months`           |
| `{d}`   | Days                     | `4 days`             |
| `{h}`   | Hours                    | `5 hours`            |
| `{m}`   | Minutes                  | `6 minutes`          |
| `{s}`   | Seconds                  | `30 seconds`         |

These tokens are replaced dynamically based on the player's remaining time and are **localized** using the player’s selected language file.

For example:

```yaml
general:
  time:
    hour: "hour"
    hours: "hours"
    minute: "minute"
    minutes: "minutes"
    ...
```

If a token has no value (e.g., 0 days), it will be removed from the final output to keep the display clean.

> You can reorder or remove tokens depending on how much detail you want to show (e.g., `{h} {m}`).

## 🎨 Customizing Placeholder Output

Placeholder formats are fully customizable in the selected language file (`/languages/<locale>.yml`).

You can change:
- The structure (`{h} {m} {s}`, etc.)
- The messages shown when time is `0`
- The color codes using `&` formatting

> ℹ️ Placeholders use the player's active language setting, so multi-language support applies here as well.

---

## 🧪 Testing Placeholders

You can test placeholders using PlaceholderAPI’s test command:

```bash
/papi parse <player> %timedwings_total_flight_time%
```
