title: FabledSkyBlock
---

TimedWings offers **automatic integration** with FabledSkyBlock.
If the plugin detects that FabledSkyBlock is installed on the server, integration is enabled by default — **no manual setup required**.

---

## 🔗 What does this integration do?

- Adds a new **island setting**: `Flight`
- Island owners can toggle this setting to allow or deny flight to members on their island
- Only players with flight time will be able to fly, and only if the island setting is enabled

This provides **full control** to island owners over who can fly on their land.

## 📝 Language Configuration

To change the display name of the island flight setting, you must update the FabledSkyBlock language configuration file.

Add or edit the following section in your FabledSkyBlock language file:

```yaml
Menu:
  Settings:
    Default:
      Item:
        Setting:
          TimedWingsFly:
            Displayname: '&aFlight'
```

> 🗣️ This configuration **must be set inside FabledSkyBlock’s language file**, not TimedWings.
> The `Displayname` is what players see in the island settings menu.
