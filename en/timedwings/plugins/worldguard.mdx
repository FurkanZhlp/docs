TimedWings offers built-in support for **WorldGuard**, allowing server owners to control where players can or cannot fly using region flags.

---

## ✅ What does it do?

By default, TimedWings allows players to fly based on their remaining time.
With WorldGuard integration, you can **allow or deny flight access** in specific regions using a custom flag:
`timedwings-fly`

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

To use the WorldGuard integration:

1. Make sure **WorldGuard** is installed on your server.
2. Start your server **once** to allow TimedWings to register the custom flag.
3. **Stop and restart** the server after the first boot — this ensures WorldGuard loads the new flag properly.

> ⚠️ A simple `/reload` is **not enough**. You must fully restart the server.

## ✅ Enabling WorldGuard Support

If WorldGuard is installed, TimedWings will automatically detect.

No extra configuration is needed.

You can confirm it's working by checking your console:

```
[TimedWings - INFO] 🌍 [TimedWings - WorldGuard Integration]
```

---

## 📌 Usage

After the flag has been registered, you can manage flight permissions per region:

```bash
/rg flag <region-name> timedwings-fly allow
/rg flag <region-name> timedwings-fly deny
```
### 🔹 allow
Players will be able to use their timed flight **inside the region**.

### 🔸 deny
Players will **not** be able to use TimedWings flight **even if they have time left**.

---

## 🔍 Example

Let’s say you want to prevent flight in your PvP Arena:

```bash
/rg flag pvp-arena timedwings-fly deny
```

Now, even VIP players with flight time remaining will **not** be able to fly in that region.

## 🧪 Debugging Tips

- If the flag doesn't work, make sure the plugin was fully restarted at least once.
- Ensure the player is **actually inside** a WorldGuard region.
- Use `/rg info <region>` to view current flags.
