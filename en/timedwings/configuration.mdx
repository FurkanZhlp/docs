This page explains how to configure TimedWings using the `config.yml` file generated after first launch.

You can find the file at:

```bash
/plugins/TimedWings/config.yml
```

## 🌐 Language Settings

TimedWings supports multi-language through locale-based `.yml` files.

```yaml
language:
  default: "en_us"
  use-client-language:
    status: true
    fallback-language: "en_us"
```

- **default**: Language used by default.
- **use-client-language.status**: If `true`, uses the player's Minecraft client language.
- **fallback-language**: Used when translation for the player's language is missing.

> 📁 Place language files in the `/languages` folder using locale codes
> (e.g., `en_us.yml`, `tr_tr.yml`, `de_de.yml`)

More locale codes: [Minecraft Language List](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language)

## 💾 Storage Settings

```yaml
storage:
  type: "yaml"
```

- Available types: `yaml`, `sqlite`, `mysql`, `h2`

### MySQL Configuration

Only required if you are using `mysql` as your storage type:

```yaml
mysql:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 3306
  database: "timedwings"
  username: "timedwings"
  password: "timedwings"
  table: "timedwings"
```

> 🧠 MySQL is required for multi-server setups to sync player data across instances.

## 🔐 Unlimited Flight Permissions

```yaml
permissions:
  - 'timedwings.unlimited'
  - 'essentials.fly'
  - 'cmi.command.fly'
```

Players with any of these permissions will **not be limited by time** and can fly freely.

---

## 🌍 Disabled Worlds

```yaml
disabled-worlds:
  - 'disabled-world'
```

Players in these worlds can fly without time limits (if they have permission).

---

## ✈️ Auto-Fly

```yaml
auto-fly: true
```

If enabled, players will automatically enter flight mode when entering a flyable area (with flight time available).

---

## 📊 Action Bar Display

```yaml
action-bar:
  enabled: true
  duration-format: '{h} {m} {s}'
  always-display: false
```

- **enabled**: Toggle action bar messages on/off
- **duration-format**: Format of the remaining time in the action bar
Placeholders: `{y}`, `{mo}`, `{d}`, `{h}`, `{m}`, `{s}`
- **always-display**: If `true`, shows the action bar even when not flying

> ✏️ To change the message appearance (colors, icons, etc.), edit your selected language file in `/languages/`.
